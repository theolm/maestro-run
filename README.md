# Maestro-run: Maestro UI Test GitHub Action

This GitHub Action allows you to run UI tests using the [Maestro](https://cloud.mobile.dev/) framework. Maestro is designed to help developers automate their app's user interface testing on Android and iOS.

This action relies on the [GitHub Action - Android Emulator Runner](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner) to run the tests on an Android emulator.

## 🚧 Early Stages Notice 🚧

This action is currently in **early development**. The features and API are subject to change as improvements and new capabilities are introduced. Be aware that breaking changes might occur until a stable version is released.

For now the action only supports **android applications**.
